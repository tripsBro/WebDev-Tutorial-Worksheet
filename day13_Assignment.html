    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! my name is Rahul Tripathy. I am co-founder of Unicom Solutions and Feel Fit. I am a third year student and
        want to do MBA after graduation as I think that creating new technologies is cool but is lifeless if
        it cannot sustain itself and will remain as a cool project to next set of students another year. Now giving an
        idea a perfect buisness model can not only scale the idea to a much larger levels but inspire new technologies
        as well. This page is about my journey from hating startups to being involved in three startups. The story in
        a way interestingly shows how my way of thinking and seeing the world changed from "it's cool!" to
        "Great! let's make this f**ing thing sell-able."
        <br>

    <h2>Scene 1: The class debate</h2>
    <p>
        "Wrong!" I said, quickly scanning the class and hiding my fingers in my pocket to cover my nervousness.
        "Start-up has just become a trendy excuse for people continously failing in their exams. Every other person in
        this room wants to be an entrepreneur but have no base whatsoever. No one has a product whatsoever but want to
        start up. As a result they will cling on to any idea that's looking 'cool' and 2 or three years later will have
        to ditch it and become unemployed again. You all are lying...does no one want to create cool tech at google or
        work for facebook! Lies, people lie as they give up easily to things going hard for them." Well to be honest I
        just had said a bunch of people, who I don't even know and about to share this class for a semester, liars and
        losers to their face. I wish I would stop sweating.
        <br>
        Now that was me, tech oriented, keen to learn and want to do nothing but put on music and code for the rest of my life.
        How did that change? Where did it go?

    <h3> Explaination</h3>
    <p>
        To understand myself consider these points:-
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I was in electronics but wanted CSE my <strong> whole</strong> life.</li>
        <li>When I see a blank coding screen I don't know why but I am prompted to write something magical!</li>
        <li>Robots were love and only stuff I saw was people giving tech sessions.</li>
        <li> I am not physically well built or look good so either sports or social life is out of picture.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>The span will be used in CSS but for now <span>this</span> is how span looks like.</h1>

    Now the header above was a h1 header. Now we have 6 different kinds of headers. These are:-
<ol>
    <li><h1>H1 header looks like this!</h1></li>
    <li><h2>H2 header looks like this!</h2></li>
    <li><h3>H3 header looks like this!</h3></li>
    <li><h4>H4 header looks like this!</h4></li>
    <li><h5>H5 header looks like this!</h5></li>
    <li><h6>H6 header looks like this!</h6></li>
</ol>
<p>
Now in day6 I learnt block quotes. Now the next para is a qoute.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            If you only do what you can do....
    then you will never be more than you are now.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p> Lastly in day 7 I learnt how to give hyperlinks to other websites using anchor tags. So, to go to my personal blog in the same tab,
    click <a href="https://tripsbro.blogspot.in/">here</a>. To open it in new tab, click <a href="https://tripsbro.blogspot.in/" target="_blank">here</a>

    Next I learnt how to link different html files. like <a href="day3.html">this</a> will take you to prev and this to next.
